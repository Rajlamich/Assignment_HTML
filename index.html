            <h4>**Nepal Hikes Everest Climbing Fees and Introduces Stricter Regulations**</h4>

<p>Nepal has significantly increased Everest climbing permit fees and introduced a series of measures aimed at controlling garbage pollution and preventing accidents on the planet’s tallest peak.</p>

<p>Under the revised rules, every two climbers must hire a guide to climb any mountain over 8,000 meters, including Everest. These revisions, approved during the Cabinet meeting on January 8, will soon be published in the Nepal Gazette.</p>

<b>Revised Climbing Fees</b>
<p>The new regulations raise the royalty fee for foreigners climbing Everest from the normal south route in the spring season (March-May) to $15,000 per person, up from the current $11,000. For the autumn season (September-November), the fee has increased from $5,500 to $7,500. Similarly, the permit cost for the winter (December-February) and monsoon (June-August) seasons has risen from $2,750 to $3,750.</p>

<p>The new rates will take effect on September 1, 2025. Bookings already confirmed for the spring 2025 expedition will not be affected by this change, according to Indu Ghimire, a joint secretary at the Tourism Ministry.</p>

<p>This is the first revision of royalty fees since January 1, 2015, when the government switched from a group-based system to a uniform fee of $11,000 per climber for the spring season. For Nepali climbers, the royalty fee for the normal route during the spring climbing season has doubled from Rs75,000 to Rs150,000.</p>

<b>Reduced Permit Validity</b>
<p>Climbing permits, which were previously valid for 75 days, will now be limited to 55 days. This reduced validity is aimed at streamlining climbing activities and ensuring better regulation of expeditions.</p>

<b>Focus on Environmental Management</b>
<p>The new rules emphasize garbage management, social security for high-altitude workers, and increased government revenue. Starting from the upcoming spring season, Everest climbers will be required to bring their waste, including human waste, back to base camp for proper disposal. Climbers must carry biodegradable bags to collect waste in the upper reaches.</p>

<p>Base camps typically provide designated toilet tents with barrels for human waste collection. However, in higher camps, many agencies rely on pits, with only a few providing biodegradable bags. Last spring, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality mandated the use of biodegradable waste bags, selling 1,700 bags. This initiative is now mandatory for climbers scaling peaks over 8,000 meters.</p>

<p>Mandatory waste collection is part of broader efforts to address environmental degradation in the Everest region. Unsustainable practices, such as leaving behind oxygen canisters, abandoned tents, food packaging, and human waste, have tarnished the region’s natural beauty and created health hazards for local communities.</p>

<b>Restrictions and Insurance Changes</b>
<p>Under the new rules, climbers are prohibited from carrying items not listed in their permit documentation issued by the Department of Tourism. Paragliding from mountains above 8,000 meters is allowed only during descents and requires prior authorization.</p>

<p>The government has also increased insurance coverage for high-altitude workers. Insurance for high-altitude guides has risen to Rs2 million ($14,400) from Rs1.5 million ($10,800), while coverage for base camp workers has increased to Rs1.5 million ($10,800) from Rs800,000 ($5,760). This change aims to provide better security for Sherpas and other support staff who face significant risks while assisting climbers.</p>

<b>Rescue and Cleaning Efforts</b>
<p>The amended rules also allow rescue teams and cleaning campaign members to collect garbage and dead bodies up to Camp IV of Everest without paying additional fees. These measures are part of a larger initiative to preserve the Everest region’s ecosystem and improve safety for climbers and workers alike.</p>

<p>By introducing these changes, Nepal aims to balance its responsibilities as a steward of one of the world’s most iconic destinations while addressing long-standing issues in its mountaineering industry.</p>
